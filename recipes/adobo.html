                <li>⅓ cup white vinegar</li>

            <h3>How to cook Adobo Step-by-Step</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken pieces until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside.</li>
                <li>Add onion and garlic to the skillet; cook until softened and brown, about 6 minutes.</li>
                <li>Pour in soy sauce and vinegar and season with garlic powder, black pepper, and bay leaf.</li>
                <li>Return chicken to pan, increase heat to high, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken is tender and cooked through, 35 to 40 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Cooking Tips for Adobo</h3>
            <p>Cooking adobo is relatively simple, but there are a few things to keep in mind to ensure an authentic, flavorful dish:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use a fatty cut of meat. This kind of cut will result in a more tender and flavorful dish.</li>
                <li>Marinate the meat overnight. The longer you marinate the meat, the more intense flavors you'll unlock.</li>
                <li>Low and slow cooking method. Adobo is typically cooked over low heat for a long period of time. This allows the flavors to meld together and the meat to become tender.</li>
                <li>Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. Adobo is a dish that can be adjusted to suit personal preferences. If you prefer a sweeter adobo, add a bit more sugar. Throw in more chili peppers if you like it hot.</li>
            </ul>
